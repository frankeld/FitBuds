# Pickhacks 2019 Entry: FitBuds
## Inspiration
We wanted FitBuds to not only be a unique service, but also one that served an overlooked segment of the population: senior citizens. According to the CDC, physically active older adults should incorporate around 2.5 hours of moderate endurance activity into their weeks to preserve physical function and mobility. However, more than 2/3 of adults do not reach this number.

Compounding this problem, most athletics programs overlook the needs of senior citizens and don‚Äôt properly encourage healthy and safe exercise habits. This is especially important considering the impact of exercise on reducing the severity/frequency of falls, and the power of exercise to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes (all of which are chronic conditions that many older adults face).

With those goals in mind, we decided we wanted to create an easy-to-use and intuitive service that assists the elderly in tracking, managing, and even improving their health. Hence, FitBuds aims to be simple, functionally reliable, and informative.

## What it does
FitBuds tracks the ‚Äúaptitudes‚Äù of users through a mobile app and through surveys on the website. The mobile app tracks the movements of an individual and uses the data collected to compute a score for three aptitudes: strength, balance, and flexibility (the major components of physical health). These can indicate the risks of developing conditions. Lifestyle information gathered through the web app also play a part in this evaluation. 

Machine learning analyzes this data and then recommends the best type of exercise to address deficient areas. The app, however, goes even further and also uses the current location of user to find nearby gyms and senior service centers with active wellness programs for older adults or low-impact exercises like yoga and swimming. Users can then improve their health and track their progress, along with possibly receiving reminder alerts or nutritional tips (another major concern around the health of older adults). 

## How we built it
The site is served by an Apache/MySQL host. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL, the web app allows users to create accounts and securely store their health information and personal history. In addition, an iOS app (written in Swift with Cocoapods in Ruby) works in tandem with the site through a RESTful API and QR code login system. As a result, user do not have to remember their passwords in order to securely update their analytics ‚Äî a critical feature to allow adults with lower digital literacy to still take advantage of the service. The app also implements supervised machine learning through support vector machines with a radial basis function kernel trained in Python (more detail on the trial and error around the neural networks for the more technically minded folks below üòâ).


## Challenges we ran into
We massively underestimated the work required for the application that allowed users to seamlessly access their information and 

## Accomplishments or moments that we‚Äôre proud of
* The moment I‚Äôm most proud of is when our machine learning code started to correctly label the various conditions of stability after spending a bunch of time recording example data and fiddling with it. **-Morgen**
* I‚Äôm proud of our teamwork skills. We worked well as a team and we all stepped up as leaders to help make the project a success. **-Calvin**
* My proudest moment was being able to contribute to a really cool project even if it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd had experience in because it really excites me for my future in CS! **-Paul**
* I did stuff. **-David**

## What we learned
* I learned a lot about machine learning, how it processes data, and how we can effectively apply it to fit our needs and simplify the problems we were facing. **-Morgen**
* I learned just how deceptively complex some websites can be, and how they can implement several languages. I also learned how to ask for help and communicate what I am trying to accomplish to others. **-Calvin**
* I learned how crucial both front- and back-end web development are no matter what kind of project you‚Äôre creating. **-Paul**
* I learned stuff. **-David**

## Future plans for FitBuds
In the future, we‚Äôd like to add a wider range of exercise monitoring apart from balance while walking. Other applications could include
